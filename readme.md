- Support for multiple databases, currently only H2, with plans to Add PostgreSQL and MySQL and more.
- Uses Repositories to perform CRUD operations, using Singleton design pattern.
- Uses JINQ to create type-safe queries using Java Functional API

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].

### Building the docs

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
$ mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.
